sfml-controller
===============

A collection of interfaces between SFML and various controllers. This uses SFML version 2.1 (http://sfml-dev.org/resources.php). Code is subject to breaking changes whenever a better method occurs to me.

Code listing:

joystick_test.cpp - a loop that prints the status of connected controllers

Xbox360Controller.h - interface for Xbox 360 Controller (Wireless, tested on OS X using the Tattiebogle.net driver: http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver)
